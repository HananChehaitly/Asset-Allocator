The purpose of this code is to solve a mathematical challenge that investors encounter when they want to allocate their assets. 

The code outputs the weights that will minimize the variance of a portfolio in order to maximize diversification using **NumPy**. 

The solution is found by using Lagrange multiplier method from Calculus, which finds the local maximum and minimum of a multivariate function
subject to a constraint. In this case, the constraint is that the sum of the weights is obviously equal to 1.
